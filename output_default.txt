<tag>: 1, 	<sentence> Eventually the hostages start sympathizing their captor, which I can't understand, since I don't find these people so likable.Luckily it didn't end well for them.Dog Day Afternoon is directed by the legendary Sidney Lumet.It's written by Frank Pierson.Al Pacino does a great performance as Sonny Wortzik.John Gazale, who did nothing but great performances during his life, plays Sal.Charles Durning is brilliant as Detective Eugene Moretti.Chris Sarandon is Leon Shermer.James Broderick portrays Sheldon.Carol Kane does the role of Jenny.Lance Henriksen plays Murphy.Judith Malina is Vi-mother and Dominick Chianese is her husband.Robert Costanzo is seen as New York policeman.This is a good movie, even though it doesn't belong to my all time favorites- list.It's a great moment when Sonny shouts "Attica!" outside the bank.A movie for all movie buffs.

the British touch in the movie was clear and distinct

in the other hand it wasn't good enough for a romantic movie and not an emotional tearjerker
